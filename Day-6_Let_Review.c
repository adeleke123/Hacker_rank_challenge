/*
Task
Given a string, , of length  that is indexed from  to , print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as  space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

Note:  is considered to be an even index.

Example


Print abc def

Input Format

The first line contains an integer,  (the number of test cases).
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contain a string, .

Constraints

Output Format

For each String  (where ), print 's even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by 's odd-indexed characters.

Explanation

Test Case 0:






The even indices are , , and , and the odd indices are , , and . We then print a single line of  space-separated strings; the first string contains the ordered characters from 's even indices (), and the second string contains the ordered characters from 's odd indices ().

Test Case 1:




The even indices are  and , and the odd indices are  and . We then print a single line of  space-separated strings; the first string contains the ordered characters from 's even indices (), and the second string contains the ordered characters from 's odd indices ().
